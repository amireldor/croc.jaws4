npm tasks:
----------

 - `dev-server`
 - `dev-client`
 
They run rollup with the appropriate config file to watch over changes
in code and builds bundles accordingly.

 - `mon`
 
This runs `nodemon` in dev settings inside the build folder. This will
not re-render pug templates instead of compiling them. This is
sometimes good for you.
